    <h2 class="h3">Coit Tower</h2>

    <div class="content">
      <p>
        Coit Tower, also known as the Lillian Coit Memorial Tower, is a
        210-foot (64 m) tower in the Telegraph Hill neighborhood of San
        Francisco, California. The tower, in the city's Pioneer Park, was
        built in 1933 using Lillie Hitchcock Coit's bequest to beautify the
        city of San Francisco; at her death in 1929 Coit left one-third of her
        estate to the city for civic beautification. The tower was proposed in
        1931 as an appropriate use of Coit's gift. It was added to the National
        Register of Historic Places on January 29, 2008.

      <p>
        The art deco tower, built of unpainted reinforced concrete, was
        designed by architects Arthur Brown, Jr. and Henry Howard, with fresco
        murals by 27 different on-site artists and their numerous assistants,
        plus two additional paintings installed after creation off-site.
        Although an apocryphal story claims that the tower was designed to
        resemble a fire hose nozzle due to Coit's affinity with the San
        Francisco firefighters of the day, the resemblance is coincidental.

    <h2 class="h3">Alamo Square</h2>

    <div class="content">
      <p>
        Alamo Square is a residential neighborhood and park in San Francisco,
        California, in the Western Addition. Its boundaries are not
        well-defined, but are generally considered to be Webster Street on the
        east, Golden Gate Avenue on the north, Divisadero Street on the west,
        and Fell Street on the south.
      </p>

      <p>
        <img class="imgB" src="images/alamo-square-small.jpg" alt="The Painted Ladies of Alamo Square">
        Alamo Square Park, the neighborhood's focal point and namesake,
        consists of four city blocks at the top of a hill overlooking much of
        downtown San Francisco, with a number of large and architecturally
        distinctive mansions along the perimeter. The park is bordered by Hayes
        Street to the south, Steiner Street to the east, Fulton Street to the
        north, and Scott Street to the west.
      </p>

      <p>
        A row of Victorian houses facing the park on Steiner Street, known as
        the "Painted Ladies", are often shown in the foreground of panoramic
        pictures of the city's downtown area. A number of movies, television
        shows and commercials have been filmed in or around Alamo Square. The
        park features heavily in the 1978 horror film The Invasion of the Body
        Snatchers, and the romantic comedy The Five-Year Engagement. The
        opening sequence of the American sitcom Full House (1987-1995) features
        a romp in Alamo Square Park with the famous row of Victorians in the
        background.
