            If I'm curt with you it's because time is a factor. I think fast, I talk fast and I
            need you guys to act fast if you wanna get out of this. So, pretty please... with sugar
            on top. Clean the fucking car.

            Beneath this mask there is more than flesh. Beneath this mask there is an idea, Mr. Creedy.

            You are right, I have always known about man. From the evidence, I believe his wisdom
            must walk hand and hand with his idiocy. His emotions must rule his brain. He must be
            a warlike creature who gives battle to everything around him, even himself.
